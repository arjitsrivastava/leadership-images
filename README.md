# Leadership & Management Images

This repository stores a bunch of leadership and management diagrams—like “Ladder of Autonomy”—that **you’re free to use and remix**. All I ask is that you **_give me proper credit_**. 

> **TL;DR**: If you use my images, please link back to this repo or mention my name. Don’t be a jerk. That’s all I’m asking.
